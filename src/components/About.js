          Hi, I'm Jonathan. I have always loved to solve problems, no matter the difficulty or magnitude of the problem. What I enjoy the most is not the result, but the process of solving the problem because I believe that I am always learning something new. This belief and my passion for technology is what drives me to become a successful software developer. I hope you can become part of my journey!
